## 👋 About

I am a **Staff-level software engineer** specializing in **backend platforms, modular APIs, and security-aware system design**.

My work centers on building systems that:
- Scale across **teams and products**
- Remain **understandable under pressure**
- Prioritize **clarity, documentation, and long-term ownership**
- Enable engineers to move fast *without breaking trust*

I’ve worked across startups, production systems, and security-focused environments, often in roles where I was responsible not just for code—but for **how teams succeed on top of that code**.

---

## 🔭 Current Focus

- **Obsidian Control Plane**  
  A multi-tenant engineering workflow backend designed to support multiple companies under a shared platform.  
  Focus areas: org/company tenancy, membership-driven RBAC, audit logging, and documentation-first APIs.

- **Pathscribe**  
  API detection and generation tooling to reduce friction between backend implementation and documentation.  
  Built to support modular architectures and improve delivery velocity.

- **NeuroTerp Index**  
  Structured data modeling and indexing project focused on clean schemas, ETL-friendly pipelines, and reference-grade data.

- **Wicked Crimson**  
  Cybersecurity training and tooling initiative focused on practical defense, monitoring, and education.

## 🧭 How I Think About Systems

When designing software, I optimize for **clarity, longevity, and team scalability** over novelty.

### 1. Architecture Enables People  
Good architecture reduces cognitive load.
- Clear module boundaries
- Predictable data contracts
- Documentation that lives with the code

If a system requires tribal knowledge to change, it will fail as teams grow.

---

### 2. Platforms > Projects  
I prefer building **platform foundations** that support multiple products and teams.
- Shared authentication and authorization
- Reusable domain models
- Consistent observability and audit trails

This mindset informs my work on **Obsidian Control Plane** and my backend leadership at **GunKustom**.

---

### 3. Defaults Matter  
Systems should be safe and usable *by default*.
- Secure-by-default APIs
- Explicit permissions (RBAC)
- Sensible error handling and logging

If a mistake is easy to make, it will be made—eventually.

---

### 4. Documentation Is a First-Class Feature  
Documentation is not an afterthought.
- API contracts are written alongside implementation
- Architectural decisions are captured near the code
- New engineers should ramp without direct hand-holding

This philosophy directly informs **Pathscribe**.

---

### 5. Humans Are Part of the System  
Software exists in human environments.
- Engineers get tired
- Context switches happen
- Stress exposes weak abstractions

I design systems to remain understandable *under real-world conditions*.
